<p><strong>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Interior Border Gateway Protocol (IBGP)</li><li>Exterior Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the core routing protocol used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems on the internet. It has two primary market types: Interior BGP (IBGP) and Exterior BGP (EBGP). IBGP is utilized within a single autonomous system, allowing routers to share routing information internally while maintaining external relationships. In contrast, EBGP is used for routing between different autonomous systems, facilitating communication and data transfer across the broader internet. Both types ensure efficient routing and network stability.</p></p>
