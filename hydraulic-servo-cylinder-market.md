<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Servo Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting</li><li>Double Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydraulic servo cylinder market comprises two primary types: single acting and double acting cylinders. Single acting cylinders utilize hydraulic pressure to create force in one direction, relying on gravity or springs for return motion, making them simpler and more cost-effective for applications requiring less control. In contrast, double acting cylinders generate force in both directions using hydraulic pressure, offering greater control and versatility in applications. This makes them suitable for demanding tasks where precision and responsiveness are essential.</p></p>
